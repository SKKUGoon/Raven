# Raven

## Summary
Raven is a Rust-powered market data service centered around two CLIs: `raven` launches the streaming server, while `ravenctl` orchestrates live collectors across supported exchanges like Binance spot and futures. Together they let operators stand up the gRPC API, start exchange feeds, and stream validated market data in real time. The runtime orchestrated by `app::run()` wires together configuration loading, dependency validation, InfluxDB persistence, and graceful shutdown handling, exposing both public streaming APIs and a control plane for collectors.

## Installation
1. **Download the release tarball:**
   ```bash
   VERSION=v0.1.5
   wget https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>/releases/download/${VERSION}/raven-${VERSION}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
   ```
2. **Extract the binaries:**
   ```bash
   tar -xzf raven-${VERSION}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
   ```
3. **Install system-wide:**
   ```bash
   sudo mv raven ravenctl /usr/local/bin
   ```
4. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   raven -V
   ravenctl --version
   ```

Replace `VERSION` with the desired release tag when downloading new builds.

## CLI Reference

### Raven (`raven` binary)
- **Purpose:** Starts the market data server and wires configuration, storage, and gRPC services.
- **Environment selection:** Set `ENVIRONMENT=<tier>` (default: `development`). The loader resolves `config/<tier>.toml` unless a CLI override is supplied.
- **Configuration overrides:** Provide a path with `--config /path/to/config.toml` to bypass environment defaults.
- **Symbol filters:** Use `--symbols BTCUSDT,ETHUSDT` to limit collectors to a comma-delimited list when starting via CLI.
- **Version details:** `cargo run --bin raven -- --help` prints build metadata (version, git SHA, rustc) sourced from `src/app/cli.rs`.

```bash
# Run the server with the default development configuration
ENVIRONMENT=development cargo run --bin raven

# Override the configuration file
cargo run --bin raven -- --config config/local.toml

# Limit subscriptions to specific symbols
cargo run --bin raven -- --symbols BTCUSDT,ETHUSDT
```

During startup the CLI emits ASCII art, version information, and applies any overrides before invoking `app::run()`.

### Raven Control (`ravenctl` binary)
- **Purpose:** Manages live exchange collectors and inspects configuration through the control gRPC service (`http://127.0.0.1:50052` by default).
- **Target server:** Override with `--server http://host:port` when the control plane is exposed elsewhere.
- **Collection lifecycle:** `use` starts a collector, `stop` terminates it, and `list` prints the current roster with uptime details.
- **Configuration utilities:** `validate`, `show`, `health`, and `template` delegate to `ConfigUtils` helpers to audit, render, or scaffold configuration files.

```bash
# Start Binance futures collection for BTCUSDT
cargo run --bin ravenctl -- use --exchange binance_futures --symbol BTCUSDT

# Stop the collection
cargo run --bin ravenctl -- stop --exchange binance_futures --symbol BTCUSDT

# Inspect active collectors
cargo run --bin ravenctl -- list

# Validate a specific configuration file
cargo run --bin ravenctl -- validate --config config/example.toml

# Render the current configuration in JSON
cargo run --bin ravenctl -- show --format json
```

All subcommands reuse the same connection bootstrap logic, surface errors with descriptive messages, and rely on `CollectorManager` to orchestrate asynchronous ingestion tasks.

## Dependencies
- Rust 1.70+
- Cargo toolchain
- InfluxDB 2.x instance (local or remote) for persistence
- Access to target exchange WebSocket endpoints (e.g., Binance spot and futures)

## Key Capabilities
- **High-frequency ingestion:** `HighFrequencyHandler` writes directly into lock-free `HighFrequencyStorage` for ultra-low latency updates.
- **Dynamic subscriptions:** `SubscriptionManager` tracks client state, topic routing, heartbeats, and reconnection persistence.
- **Circuit-protected storage:** `Citadel` validates, sanitizes, and persists data to InfluxDB with dead-letter recovery paths.
- **gRPC fan-out:** `MarketDataServer` enforces connection limits while streaming snapshots and live updates to clients.
- **Operational visibility:** Health, metrics, and tracing services expose readiness, active collectors, and performance counters.

## Architecture
### Runtime Flow
1. **Bootstrap:** `app::startup` loads configuration via `ConfigLoader`, applies CLI overrides, validates port availability, and initializes logging.
2. **Foundation services:** Dead letter queues, circuit breakers, and InfluxDB clients are created before the data plane spins up.
3. **Data plane:** `Citadel` plus `HighFrequencyStorage` hold validated data; the snapshot service periodically publishes in-memory state and persists batches.
4. **Serving layer:** `MarketDataServer::start()` exposes the `MarketDataService` gRPC API, while `ControlService` listens on a loopback port for administrative commands.
5. **Shutdown:** Coordinated stop signals abort gRPC tasks, drain collectors, flush queues, and dispose monitoring handles gracefully.

### Component Map
- `src/app` – CLI parsing, startup wiring, shutdown, and version reporting.
- `src/citadel` – Validation engine, atomic storage abstractions, and snapshot broadcasting.
- `src/server` – Connection gating plus gRPC surface backed by subscription routing and historical queries.
- `src/control` – `CollectorManager` that starts/stops exchange collectors through the control gRPC interface.
- `src/exchanges/binance` – WebSocket adapters and parsers for Binance spot and futures feeds.
- `src/config` – Loader, builder, validation, and sectioned TOML schemas with hot-reload support.
- `proto/` – Market data, subscription, and control plane protocol buffers compiled by `build.rs`.

## Configuration
Raven looks for `ENVIRONMENT` (default `development`) and loads `config/<environment>.toml` via `ConfigLoader`. Each config is split into `[server]`, `[database]`, `[data_processing]`, `[retention_policies]`, `[batching]`, and `[monitoring]` sections, validated by `RuntimeConfig::validate()`. Environment variables prefixed with `RAVEN__` can override settings at runtime.

For local work, copy `config/example.toml` to `config/development.toml` and fill in InfluxDB credentials. Production deployments use `config/secret.toml`, which should remain outside version control.

## Running Locally
1. **Install prerequisites:** Rust 1.70+ and access to an InfluxDB 2.x instance.
2. **Fetch dependencies:** `cargo fetch` (optional) to warm the build cache.
3. **Launch the server:**
   ```bash
   ENVIRONMENT=development cargo run --bin raven
   ```
4. **Override configuration file:**
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin raven -- --config /path/to/custom.toml
   ```
5. **Stream specific symbols:**
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin raven -- --symbols BTCUSDT,ETHUSDT
   ```

## Monitoring
- **Health checks:** HTTP health service listens on `monitoring.health_check_port` with component-level diagnostics.
- **Metrics:** Prometheus metrics expose connection counts, ingestion stats, and circuit breaker signals at `monitoring.metrics_port`.
- **Tracing:** `TracingService` wires `tracing` spans through OpenTelemetry exporters when enabled.

Use `curl http://localhost:9091/health` and `curl http://localhost:9090/metrics` (default ports) to verify the service.

## Testing
- **All tests:** `cargo test --all`
- **Unit tests:** `cargo test --test unit`
- **Integration tests:** `cargo test --test integration`

The unit suite exercises subscription routing, connection management, and Citadel validation logic, while integration tests spin up higher-level flows for config, exchanges, and server boundaries.

## Development Workflow
The repository includes a Makefile with wrappers for common Rust commands (`make fmt`, `make lint`, `make test`). These targets are intended purely for development convenience; the canonical build and execution flow remains the direct Cargo commands shown above.

## Repository Layout
- `src/main.rs` – Application entry point delegating to `app::run()`.
- `src/bin/ravenctl.rs` – Operational CLI for collectors and configuration introspection.
- `src/monitoring` – Health, metrics, and tracing service implementations.
- `tests/` – Unit and integration suites grouped by domain under `tests/unit` and `tests/integration`.
- `python_client/` – Smoke-test gRPC client aligned with the protobuf schema.
